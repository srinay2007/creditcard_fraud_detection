# creditcard_fraud_detection
Creditcard_fraud_detection Project

This project is to build solution to cater to Credit Card Fraud detection. This will detect fraudelent transactions, when card member swipes their card for payment, the transaction is classified as fraudulent or authentic based on a set of predefined rules. If fraud is detected, then the transaction must be declined. Incorrectly classifying a transaction as fraudulent will incur huge losses to the company and also provoke negative consumer sentiment.

As part of the project, broadly, below are the tasks 
Mid submission:
Task 1: Load the transactions history data (card_transactions.csv) in a NoSQL database.
Task 2: Ingest the relevant data from AWS RDS to Hadoop.
Upload a zip file containing the following:
Task 4: After creating the table, you need to load the relevant data in the lookup table.
Final Submission: 
Task 5: Create a streaming data processing framework that ingests real-time POS transaction data from Kafka. The transaction data is then validated based on the three rules’ parameters (stored in the NoSQL database) discussed previously.
Task 6: Update the transactions data along with the status (fraud/genuine) in the card_transactions table.
Task 7: Store the ‘postcode’ and ‘transaction_dt’ of the current transaction in the look-up table in the NoSQL database if the transaction was classified as genuine.

The following tables containing data will be created to solve this problem:

card_member – This table will store the cardholder’s data in a central AWS RDS
• card_id: This refers to the card number.
• member_id: This is the 15-digit member ID of the cardholder.
• member_joining_dt: This is the date and time of joining of new member.
• card_purchase_dt: This is the date on which the card was purchased.
• country: This is the country in which the card was purchased.
• city: This is the city in which the card was purchased.

card_transactions – This table will store all incoming transactions (fraud/genuine) swiped at point of sale (POS) terminals.
• card_id: This refers to the card number.
• member_id: This is the 15-digit member ID of the cardholder.
• amount: This is the amount that is swiped with respect to the card_id.
• postcode: This is the ZIP code at which this card was swiped (marking the location of an event).
• pos_id: This is the merchant’s POS terminal ID, using which the card was swiped.
• transaction_dt: This is the date and time of the transaction.
• status: This indicates whether the transaction was approved or not, with a genuine/fraud value.

member_score – This table will store the member credit score data in a central AWS RDS.
• member_id: This is the 15-digit member ID of the cardholder.
• score: This is the score assigned to a member defining their credit history, generated by upstream systems.
